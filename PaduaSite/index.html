                    Welcome to Padova! The city is the capital of the Italian Province of Padua.
                    It is also the economic and communication hub of the province. It is usually
                    included in the Padua-Treviso-Venice Metropolitan Area, a region with a population
                    of about 1.6 million people. The city is picturesque, with a dense network of arcaded
                    streets opening into large communal piazze, and many bridges crossing the various branches
                    of the Bacchiglione river, which once surrounded the ancient walls like a moat. Padua is the
                    setting for most of the action in Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew.
                    The city is also known for being the city where Saint Anthony, a Portuguese Franciscan
                    spent part of his life and died in 1231.

                    Padua claims to be the oldest city in northern Italy. According to a tradition
                    dated at least to the time of Virgil's Aeneid and to Livy's Ab Urbe Condita, Padua
                    was founded in around 1183 BC by the Trojan prince Antenor. After the Fall of Troy,
                    Antenor led a group of Trojans and their Paphlagonian allies, the Eneti or Veneti,
                    who lost their king Pylaemenes to settle the Euganean plain in Italy. Thus, when a
                    large ancient stone sarcophagus was exhumed in the year 1274, officials of the medieval
                    commune declared the remains within to be those of Antenor.

                    The Scrovegni Chapel (Italian: Cappella degli Scrovegni) is Padua's most notable sight.
                    It houses a cycle of frescoes completed in 1305 by Giotto. It was commissioned by Enrico
                    degli Scrovegni, a wealthy banker, as a private chapel once attached to his family's palazzo.
                    It is also called the "Arena Chapel" because it stands on the site of a Roman-era arena.
                    The fresco cycle details the life of the Virgin Mary and has been acknowledged by many to be
                    one of the most important fresco cycles in the world for its role in the development of European
                    painting. It also includes one of the earliest representations of a kiss in the history of art
                    (Meeting at the Golden Gate, 1305). Entrance to the chapel is an elaborate ordeal, as it involves
                    spending 15 minutes prior to entrance in a climate-controlled, airlocked vault, used to stabilize
                    the temperature between the outside world and the inside of the chapel. This is intended to protect
                    the frescoes from moisture and mold.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Palazzo della Ragione, with its great hall on the upper floor, is reputed to have the largest roof
                    unsupported by columns in Europe; the hall is nearly rectangular, its length 81.5 m (267.39 ft), its
                    breadth 27 m (88.58 ft), and its height 24 m (78.74 ft); the walls are covered with allegorical frescoes;
                    the building stands upon arches, and the upper storey is surrounded by an open loggia, not unlike that which
                    surrounds the basilica of Vicenza. The Palazzo was begun in 1172 and finished in 1219. In 1306, Fra Giovanni,
                    an Augustinian friar, covered the whole with one roof. Originally there were three roofs, spanning the three
                    chambers into which the hall was at first divided; the internal partition walls remained till the fire of 1420,
                    when the Venetian architects who undertook the restoration removed them, throwing all three spaces into one and
                    forming the present great hall, the Salone. The new space was refrescoed by Nicolo' Miretto and Stefano da Ferrara,
                    working from 1425 to 1440. Beneath the great hall, there is a centuries-old market.

                    <br>
                    The most celebrated of the Paduan churches is the Basilica di Sant'Antonio da Padova, locally known as "Il Santo".
                    The bones of the saint rest in a chapel richly ornamented with carved marble, the work of various artists, among them
                    Sansovino and Falconetto. The basilica was begun around the year 1230 and completed in the following century. Tradition
                    says that the building was designed by Nicola Pisano. It is covered by seven cupolas, two of them pyramidal. There are
                    also four cloisters. The belltower has eight bells in C.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In the Piazza dei Signori is the loggia called the Gran Guardia, (1493–1526), and close by is the Palazzo del Capitaniato,
                    the residence of the Venetian governors, with its great door, the work of Giovanni Maria Falconetto, the Veronese architect-sculptor
                    who introduced Renaissance architecture to Padua and who completed the door in 1532. Falconetto was the architect of Alvise Cornaro's
                    garden loggia, (Loggia Cornaro), the first fully Renaissance building in Padua.[24] Nearby stands the Cathedral, remodelled in 1552 after
                    a design of Michelangelo. It contains works by Nicolò Semitecolo, Francesco Bassano and Giorgio Schiavone. The nearby Baptistry, consecrated
                    in 1281, houses the most important frescoes cycle by Giusto de' Menabuoi.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    One of the best known symbols of Padua is the Prato della Valle, a 90,000 m2 (968,751.94 sq ft) elliptical square. This is one of the biggest
                    in Europe. In the centre is a wide garden surrounded by an oval canal, lined by 78 statues portraying illustrious citizens. It was created by
                    Andrea Memmo in the late 18th century. Memmo once resided in the monumental 15th-century Palazzo Angeli, which now houses the Museum of Precinema.

                    <br>
                    Abbey of Santa Giustina and adjacent Basilica. In the 15th century, it became one of the most important monasteries in the area, until it was
                    suppressed by Napoleon in 1810. In 1919 it was reopened. The tombs of several saints are housed in the interior, including those of Justine,
                    St. Prosdocimus, St. Maximus, St. Urius, St. Felicita, St. Julianus, as well as relics of the Apostle St. Matthias and the Evangelist St. Luke.
                    This is home to some art, including the Martyrdom of St. Justine by Paolo Veronese. The complex was founded in the 5th century on the tomb of
                    the namesake saint, Justine of Padua. The belltower has eight bells in B.

                    Padua has long been acclaimed for its university, founded in 1222. Under the rule of Venice the
                    university was governed by a board of three patricians, called the Riformatori dello Studio di Padova.
                    The list of notable professors and alumni is long, containing, among others, the names of Bembo, Sperone
                    Speroni, the anatomist Vesalius, Copernicus, Fallopius, Fabrizio d'Acquapendente, Galileo Galilei,
                    William Harvey, Pietro Pomponazzi, Reginald, later Cardinal Pole, Scaliger, Tasso and Jan Zamoyski.
                    It is also where, in 1678, Elena Lucrezia Cornaro Piscopia became the first woman in the world to graduate
                    from university. The university hosts the oldest anatomy theatre, built in 1594.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The university also hosts the oldest botanical garden (1545) in the world. The botanical garden Orto Botanico
                    di Padova was founded as the garden of curative herbs attached to the University's faculty of medicine. It
                    still contains an important collection of rare plants.

                    The place of Padua in the history of art is nearly as important as its place in the history of learning.
                    The presence of the university attracted many distinguished artists, such as Giotto, Fra Filippo Lippi and
                    Donatello; and for native art there was the school of Francesco Squarcione, whence issued Mantegna.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Padua is also the birthplace of the celebrated architect Andrea Palladio, whose 16th-century villas
                    in the area of Padua, Venice, Vicenza and Treviso are among the most notable of Italy and they were often
                    copied during the 18th and 19th centuries; and of Giovanni Battista Belzoni, adventurer, engineer and egyptologist.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The sculptor Antonio Canova produced his first work in Padua, one of which is among the statues of Prato della
                    Valle (presently a copy is displayed in the open air, while the original is in the Musei Civici).
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Antonianum is settled among Prato della Valle, the Basilica of Saint Anthony and the Botanic Garden.
                    It was built in 1897 by the Jesuit fathers and kept alive until 2002. During World War II, under the leadership
                    of P. Messori Roncaglia SJ, it became the center of the resistance movement against the Nazis. Indeed, it
                    briefly survived P. Messori's death and was sold by the Jesuits in 2004.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Padua also plays host to the majority of Taming of the Shrew by William Shakespeare and in Much Ado About
                    Nothing Benedick is named as "Signior Benedick of Padua".
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Paolo De Poli, painter and enamellist, author of decorative panels and design objects, 15 times invited
                    to the Venice Biennale was born in Padua. The electronic musician Tying Tiffany was also born in Padua.
